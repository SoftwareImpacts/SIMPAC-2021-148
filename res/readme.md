# Experience results and settings

For all the experiences done here, we made 100 simulations, the brith and death rate are following a normal law with mu = 5 and sigma = 2. The death rate has a frequency of 200 turns and the birth rate a frequency of 150 turns.  All the simulation use a total population of 100 000 individuals, with 30% of potentials vicitms.
